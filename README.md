ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @madelinemazurek

Iâ€™m software engineering intern who is open to work for the May 2023 to August 2023 months. 
As I am especially passionate about analytic problem solving and agile development, I am 
seeking out workplaces where I will be able to challenge myself, learn new skills, and become 
a valuable asset to the team.

Math and science have always been passions of mine, and I have shown a clear aptitude for a 
STEM career from a young age. I was eight years old when the family dishwasher broke and did 
not miss a beat before running to the toolbox, taking the whole thing apart, finding the issue, 
and fixing it all on my own. Nowadays I can frequently be found explaining to my mother how her 
cellphone works or fixing my grandparents' printer. I love the feeling of wrapping my brain 
around a complex issue and working on a problem until I can come up with a creative and elegant 
solution. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and of course writing code.

If you have questions about me please do not hesitate to reach out! :)
