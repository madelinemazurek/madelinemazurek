👋 Hi there, I’m @madelinemazurek

I’m a recent Software Engineering graduate from the University of Calgary.

As I am especially passionate about analytic problem-solving and agile development, I am 
seeking out workplaces where I will be able to challenge myself, learn new skills, and become 
a valuable asset to the team.

Math and science have always been passions of mine, and I have shown a clear aptitude for a 
STEM career from a young age. I love the feeling of wrapping my brain around a complex issue 
and working on a problem until I can come up with a creative and elegant solution. In my spare 
time, I enjoy hiking, reading, and of course writing code.


If you have questions about me please do not hesitate to reach out! :)
