ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @madelinemazurek

Iâ€™m a recent Software Engineering graduate from the University of Calgary. 

With proven experience in software development, I thrive in collaborative and fast-moving 
environments where I can learn continuously, tackle meaningful challenges, and contribute 
to building great products.

Iâ€™ve led cross-functional teams, contributed to full-stack applications, and developed tools 
ranging from data platforms to interactive browser features. Iâ€™m especially passionate about 
problem-solving, agile development, and creating intuitive, user-focused solutions.

Outside of work, I love hiking, reading, and (of course) writing fun code!

If you have questions about me please reach out, I'd love to chat ðŸ˜Š
